# Hide Tagged Notes (Obsidian Plugin)

This plugin lets you configure custom tags to hide. When hide mode is enabled, notes matching any configured tag are hidden in Obsidian's File Explorer and optionally filtered out of Graph views.

## Usage

- Turn on **hide mode** to hide notes marked with any configured hidden tag.
- Turn it off to show all notes again.
- Open plugin settings to maintain your hidden-tag list and graph behavior.
